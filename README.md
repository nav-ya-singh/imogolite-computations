# imogolite-computations
MD simulations of water dynamics in/out of imogolite nanotube at different hydration levels
We used the imogolite model as prepared/described by Scalfi et al. in [Structure and Dynamics of Water Confined in Imogolite Nanotubes](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.8b01115).
